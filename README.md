# My Roster

My roster is a project I created during my fullstack bootcamp at elevation academy if you're into NBA you'll enjoy it (tho it's updated to 2017/18). It is a front and back end project (without usage of DB - it was mid course), simple but cute with nice *css flip card effect* i like and usage of APIs.
